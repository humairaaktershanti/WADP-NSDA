**Script:**

> Thank you, Humaira.
> Our project, **InstaCore – Institute Management System**, is designed to simplify and modernize institute operations.
> Many existing systems are outdated, hard to use, and lack proper security like email verification or OTP protection.
>
> Our aim is to create a **secure, responsive, and user-friendly** platform where every user — student, teacher, or admin — can manage their accounts and tasks with ease.
>
> InstaCore will focus on **authentication, profile management, and secure data handling**, while providing a clean and modern interface.

## **02:00 – 03:20** | **Core Features (Phase 1)** *(Speaker: Khalid Mahmud – 1 min 20 sec)*

**Script:**

> For our first phase, we are building:
>
> 1. **Landing page** with login & signup buttons
> 2. **Custom authentication** using Django
> 3. **Email verification** during signup
> 4. **OTP verification** before account deletion
> 5. **User dashboard** with profile details
> 6. Profile edit, change password, and account delete options
> 7. Role-aware top navigation and fixed footer with institute info
>
> All these are designed to ensure **security and smooth navigation** for the user.

## **03:20 – 04:20** | **User Flow & Tech Stack** *(Speaker: Khalid Mahmud – 1 min)*

**Script:**

> Here’s how the system works:
> – User visits index page → chooses login or signup
> – On signup → receives email verification → then logs in
> – Dashboard → manage profile, password, and account
> – Logout safely when done
>
> For technology:
> – **Backend:** Django
> – **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
> – **Database:** SQLite for dev, PostgreSQL for production
> – **Future:** Django REST Framework for API integration
