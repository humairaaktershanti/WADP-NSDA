Great! You're working on an \*\*Institute Management System\*\*, and another team is building an \*\*Employee Management System\*\* with similar user base (admin, employee, user/customer). Since both projects share overlapping concepts (e.g., users, roles, HR, approval, finance), it’s smart to consider collaboration, \*\*code reuse\*\*, or even \*\*a modular system\*\*.

\## ✅ If You Want to Collaborate: Here’s the Way



You both can \*\*collaborate effectively\*\* by following this structure:



---



\## 🔧 1. \*\*Split Common Functionality into a Shared Django App\*\*



Create a \*\*shared app\*\* that contains reusable logic for both systems. Let’s call it:



```bash

django-admin startapp core

```



This `core` app can include:



\* `User` model \& roles

\* `Profile` model

\* `LeaveRequest`

\* `FinanceTransaction`

\* `Approval`

\* `Notifications`

\* `EditHistory`



Then in both projects:



```python

INSTALLED\_APPS = \[

&nbsp;   ...

&nbsp;   'core',

&nbsp;   'institute',

&nbsp;   'employee',  # depending on which project it is

]

```



---



\## 📁 2. \*\*Project Structure Example\*\*



Here’s how you can organize the structure:



```

/shared\_project\_root/

│

├── /core/                  # Shared app

│   ├── models.py           # Common models

│   ├── utils.py

│   └── ...

│

├── /institute\_mgmt/        # Your project

│   ├── settings.py

│   ├── /institute/         # App-specific to institute

│   └── manage.py

│

├── /employee\_mgmt/         # Other team’s project

│   ├── settings.py

│   ├── /employee/          # App-specific to employee mgmt

│   └── manage.py

```



You can place both projects under the same \*\*monorepo\*\* or Git repository if you're working closely, or separate repos pointing to a shared `core` package.

\## 🧱 3. \*\*Modular Design \& Abstract Base Classes\*\*



If roles differ between systems, you can \*\*parameterize\*\* them or use \*\*abstract base models\*\* in `core`, and extend them in each app.



```python

\# core/models.py



class AbstractUserBase(AbstractUser):

&nbsp;   id = models.UUIDField(primary\_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)

&nbsp;   email = models.EmailField(unique=True)

&nbsp;   status = models.CharField(max\_length=20, default='pending')

&nbsp;   email\_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)



&nbsp;   USERNAME\_FIELD = 'email'

&nbsp;   REQUIRED\_FIELDS = \['username']



&nbsp;   class Meta:

&nbsp;       abstract = True

```



Then in your project-specific app:



```python

\# institute/models.py

from core.models import AbstractUserBase



class User(AbstractUserBase):

&nbsp;   USER\_ROLES = \[...]

&nbsp;   role = models.CharField(max\_length=20, choices=USER\_ROLES)



\# employee/models.py

from core.models import AbstractUserBase



class EmployeeUser(AbstractUserBase):

&nbsp;   EMPLOYEE\_TYPES = \[...]

&nbsp;   role = models.CharField(max\_length=20, choices=EMPLOYEE\_TYPES)

```



---



\## 🔁 4. \*\*Use Git Submodules or Python Packages\*\*



If you're keeping the shared logic in a separate repo (`core`), you can:



\* Add it as a \*\*Git submodule\*\*

\* Or turn it into an installable package (e.g., `pip install -e ./core`)



---



\## 🤝 5. \*\*Collaboration Tips\*\*



\* Use \*\*shared GitHub org/repo\*\* with protected branches

\* Use \*\*API versioning\*\* if both systems are independently deployed

\* Set up \*\*shared documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)\*\* for backend APIs

\* Schedule \*\*weekly sync-ups\*\* if features overlap



---



\## ✅ Bonus: What to Avoid



\* Avoid duplicating models like `User`, `LeaveRequest`, `FinanceTransaction` in both projects.

\* Don’t tightly couple your Institute System logic to something generic like HR or Payroll — those should go in the shared app.

\## 🧠 Summary



| Goal                             | Approach                                  |

| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| Share user, finance, leave, etc. | Create a `core` Django app                |

| Different apps using same core   | Modularize into separate Django apps      |

| Same database or not             | Decide early: Single DB or microservices  |

| Independent yet reusable code    | Use abstract base models or separate apps |
